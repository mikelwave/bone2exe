~Hello fellow bones!~
I am your host, Bones, and
this is my Gamer Tier List.

Here I shall rank how good The Gamers are
(based on the amount of vienetta
ice cream cakes collected for me).

[event] // Event 1


[talker = 1, emotion = 2, fontsize = 10.9] //Bones, S Tier
~Incredible!~
You have looked through every nook and
cranny to find as many cakes as possible!

[event] // Event 2
A brilliant feat for all bone kind!
You deserve to be put up top with
the big boy(s)in S Tier!

[event] // Event 3
Great work and Thanks for Playing!


[talker = 1, emotion = 2, fontsize = 10.9] //Bones, A Tier
Very Well done, That's a lot of
ice cream cakes!

[event] // Event 2
You made it to A tier,
an impressive display of
gaming for sure.

[event] // Event 3
But you still haven't reached
the intimidating position of S tier...
Perhaps next time, Thanks for Playing!


[talker = 1, emotion = 0, fontsize = 10.9] //Bones, B Tier
~Believable!~ You have gone out of
your way to pick up... some ice cream
cakes throughout your journey.

[event] // Event 2
This puts you at B tier on my tier list.
Though it wouldn't hurt to go back to
get some more, surely.

[event] // Event 3
Either way, Thanks for Playing!


[talker = 1, emotion = 0, fontsize = 10.9] //Bones, C Tier
Ah, an OK amount of ice cream cakes.

[event] // Event 2
You could go back and try getting some
more, but for now this is enough to
save me a single trip to the food store.

[event] // Event 3
Thanks for Playing!


[talker = 1, emotion = 3, fontsize = 10.9] //Bones, D Tier
What? This is hardly any
ice cream cakes at all!

[event] // Event 2
Not even enough to get me
through a rainy day.

[event] // Event 3
Try going back and getting some more,
but for now Thanks for Playing!


[talker = 1, emotion = 3, fontsize = 10.9] //Bones, F Tier
~Unbelievable!~
You actually didn't get any
of the ice cream cakes!

Even the Trashbug accidentally
picked one up.

[event] // Event 2
I have lost what little respect
I have for you, but that's
how the cookie rolls.

[event] // Event 3
Thanks for Playing
(in the strictest definition possible)!
