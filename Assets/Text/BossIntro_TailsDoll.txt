So, another racer has come to challenge me.
Do you mortals never learn to just walk away?

[talker = 0, emotion = 2] //Jumpscare
First of all: This is only level 10,
why the fuck are you here?

[emotion = 0]
Second, I'm here to throw down on shitty
creepypastas, not race.

[emotion = 1] //Tails doll
By the way your creepypasta is easily the worst
one, I can smell you from down here.

[talker = 1, emotion = 0] //Tails doll
Don't swear in my level,
Thank you...
Hmmm...

...But also, you're probably right...
You really seem to like bringing others
down because of what's ultimately
free internet horror games.

My creepypasta and my games might be bad,
but at least more people will remember me than
they will remember you.

[talker = 0, emotion = 0] //Jumpscare
Nice try pal, but you winning a popularity contest
isn't gonna get to me. It will only make me want
to shoot you in the face more.

[talker = 1, emotion = 1] //Tails doll
I'm not afraid of your idle threats,
~There is no sunshine for you~.

[talker = 0, emotion = 2] //Jumpscare
No sunshine for me, huh.
So that means I have... Unshine?

[talker = 1, emotion = 0] //Tails doll
...

What?

[talker = 0, emotion = 2] //Jumpscare
Uhh...

[emotion = 1] //Jumpscare
It's a BAD joke to point out how ~STUPID~
your lines are. Your dialogue is so cliche.
I'm the one that's mocking others, not you!

[talker = 1, emotion = 1] //Tails doll
Save your whining for the finish line, comedian.
That is... ~if you can reach it before I do~.
