Look here you mario teaches typing wannabe,
your cliche creepypasta and equally
much-to-be-desired games end here. I'll be

Hypocrite that you are, you criticise
creepypastas for their cliches and overuse
of blood and gore, when your little action game
also has excessive blood and gore.

And judging by your dialog, your idea of
comedy comes from those fuckin youtube
commentary channels that bashed others for
cheap laughs and became passe like 5 years ago.

Your critisisms are empty and
destructive. They have no meat
on their bones.
