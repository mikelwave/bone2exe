Wow, that fight really completed my
character arc and shit.
Wasn't that cool, guys?

And gals?

[emotion = 1] //Jumpscare
Those creepypasta demons have a good
point though. Yeah... I see...

While all art should be criticized, if you do
so without respect or just going into it thinking
you're better than it, you'll one day just fling
shit at art that's unique and doesn't deserve it.

Though I think creepypastas aren't the highest
form of art out there, I should treat them with
respect still. Even if they can be very stupid,
that's still commendable and entertaining.

Now that I've overcome my biases, I can
truly accomplish my mission of getting
rid of the Zalgo-Virus.

AHAHAHA! I AM ROUGE.WAD!
I hold all the power to the Zalgo-Virus!
And I am going to Hijack this Story!

You shouldn't have fucked with the
forces of Zalgo, ~bone boy~!
Now this is OUR game! AHAHAHA!

[talker = 0, emotion = 2] //Jumpscare
~Not so fast~, you wretched bitch!
I have anti-viruses!

[event] //Event 3
[talker = 1, emotion = 1] //Rouge
You did not collect enough
anti-viruses to harm ME!
I am not afraid of you, ~bone boy~!

[talker = 0, emotion = 3] //Jumpscare
Oh yeah?
Well eat THIS,
Rat Face!

[event] //Event 4
[hidetime = 10]
[talker = 1, emotion = 2] //Rouge
Yeah actually, I give up. This is too
much bullshit just to corrupt some
video game characters.

[talker = 1, emotion = 2]
So fine. You win.
Go fuck yourself, ~bone boy~.
I'm outta here.

[event] //Event 5
[hidetime = 4]
[talker = 0, emotion = 0]
Welp, I saved the world from the
Zalgo-Virus, and I want to think
about it.

With a job well done, it's time to
go back home and see how well I did.
